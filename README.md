# HGT_analysis
Hello, this pipeline was created for the identification of highly confident horizontal transfer genes (hcHTGs) in a genome by comparing the Codon Usage Bias (CUB) and GC content of each gene with highly conserved and expressed genes, such as ribosomal genes.
The pipeline was developed during the analyzes of Selleri et al 2026, mSystems "Assessment of genome evolution in Bifidobacterium adolescents indicates genetic adaptation to the human gut" (doi.org/10.1128/msystems.01173).
